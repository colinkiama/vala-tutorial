# Vala Tutorial

An unofficial modern Vala tutorial

You can view this tutorial online here: https://colinkiama.github.io/vala-tutorial

This tutorial is what I wished I had while I was learning Vala.
This should not be treated as an official tutorial at all but I hope that it's helpful to you. 

## Requirements

- `sphinx >= 4.2.0`
- `furo` (Sphinx Theme)
- `sphinx-copy-button` (Sphinx Extension)
- `pygments`
- `make`

## Getting started

1. Build the website with:

```sh
make
```

or if you are using GNOME builder, you can click on the "Build" button.

2. In the `build` directory, open a html file in your favourite web browser. `index.html` contains the home page.

3. Whenever you want to rebuild the site with changes you make in `source`, repeat step 1.

## Progress
