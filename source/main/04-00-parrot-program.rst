Project 1: Parrot Program
=========================

Now you're going to create a program using some of the concepts you've learned so far.

Essentially, it will be a program that:
- Takes in a phrase that you enter
- Repeats the entered phrase numerous times 
- Prints sentences that include the phrase you entered

.. toctree::
   :hidden:

   Entering your phrase <04-01-entering-your-phrase>
   Cycle through names <04-02-cycle-through-names>

Getting started
---------------

You'll need to work on this in a new directory under your ``ValaProjects`` directory. To do this:

1. Create a new directory called ``ParrotProgram`` under your ``ValaProjects`` directory.
2. Under the ``ParrotProgram`` directory you have just created, create a new file called ``main.vala``.
