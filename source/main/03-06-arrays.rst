- How to change the flow of programs using control statements such as: ``if`` and ``switch``.
- How to perform loops using loop statements such as ``while`` and ``for``.
- How to store a collection of a specific data type using arrays

The next chapter will be a project that will use some of the topics you've learned so far.

Now would be a good idea to revise and experiment with the topics we've covered in this tutorial up until now to improve your understanding with them.
