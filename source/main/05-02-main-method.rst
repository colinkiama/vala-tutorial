Main method
===========

The work that you do in this section will be done in a new directory under your
``ValaProjects`` directory called ``MainMethods``:abbr:

1. Create the ``MainMethods`` directory under your ``ValaProjects`` directory
2. Create file called ``main.vala`` inside the ``MainMethods`` directory.

.. Reference about the original program the reader has written in the Hello World section.

In the Hello World section, you wrote the following program:

.. code-block:: vala
   :emphasize-lines: 2
   
    public static void main () {
        print ("Hello, world!\n");
    }

.. Talk about how the main method is the entry point of every Vala program. It's called by
.. the program automatically.

.. Talk about how there are different versions of the main method that can be used and
.. explain the situations where you would use them.

.. Lastly, show that you don't even need to write a main method block however it's still recommended that you do so since
.. this is a new feature that has been added in recent versions of Vala.
